# API Documentation (stub)

This file is a placeholder for full REST API documentation.

Current API reference is provided by the FastAPI app at runtime (Swagger UI).

How to view full API docs locally

1. Start the server:
```bash
python -m src.api
```
2. Open the interactive docs:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Planned contents for this file:
- Complete list of endpoints and payloads
- Examples (curl, Python requests)
- Authentication & rate limiting
- Webhook endpoints and SSE examples

You can use `docs/ADVANCED_API.md` and `API_DEMO_PHASE3.md` as interim references.
